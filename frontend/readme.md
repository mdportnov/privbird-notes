# Instructions

- Create `.env` file in the root of the project and set the `VITE_API_URL` variable to the api address
- Perform a dependency installation using the `npm install` command

The development server is started with the commands `npm run serve::dev` and `npm run serve::prod`.
The build is started with the commands `npm run build::dev` and `npm run build::prod`.
The `::dev` and `::prod` suffixes set the corresponding set of environment variables. `.env` corresponds to `::prod`.
